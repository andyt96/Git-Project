# Hello!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/64576417-bd00-4263-bf4e-3f40b0aaacaa/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mastering-git-andy/deploys)

This repository was created to help me understand how to use git on the command line. The files in this repo were pushed using git on the command line.

Another purpose of this repository is to learn how to use and deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I plan to use Netlify in the future after my Namecheap hosting plan expires.

## Basic Git Commmands
These are the basic git commands that I learned thoughtout this tutorial. I will be learning more advance git commands in the future.

`git config` - Configures your global Git account (`user.name` and `user.email`)

`git init` - Initializes your Git repo

`git status` - Checks the status of your Git repo

`git add` - Tracks the files in your directory

`git commit` - Commits your tracked files

`git push` - Uploads your files to your Git repo

`git pull` - Downloads your files from your Git repo

## The Files in this Repo
The files are just basic HTML and CSS files. They don't contain anything important. I created these files so that I have something to commit and push to this repo using the command line. You can see the files live [here](https://mastering-git-andy.netlify.com/).
