# Hello!
This repository was created to help me understand how to use git on the command line. The files in this repo were pushed using git on the command line.

## Basic Git Commmands
These are the basic git commands that I learned thoughtout this tutorial. I will be learned more advance git commands in the future.

`git config` - Configures your global Git account (`user.name` and `user.email`)

`git init` - Initializes your Git repo

`git status` - Checks the status of your Git repo

`git add` - Tracks the files in your directory

`git commit - Commits your tracked files

`git push` - Uploads your files to your Git repo

`git pull` - Downloads your files from your Git repo

## The Files in this Repo
The files are just basic HTML and CSS files. They don't contain anything important. I created these files so that I have something to commit and push to this repo using the command line.
